                            A bear that has no front paws has been living in the forests of West Virginia for eight
                            years. Scientists suggest that the absence of hind limbs is due to a congenital mutation.
                            Despite its limitations, the two-legged bear has mastered the tricks of survival and copes
                            well with difficulties.

                <p>A real revolution is coming to the world of magic! Nimbus, the company known for its high-end brooms,
                    has released a long-awaited update - the Nimbus 3000. According to rumours, the novelty is capable
                    of reaching speeds of up to 300 km/h, making it one of the fastest models in history!<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Within the walls of Hogwarts, a debate has already raged: should we change the proven Nimbus 2000
                    for the revolutionary Nimbus 3000? On the one hand, the new model promises incredible speed and
                    manoeuvrability. On the other hand, the Nimbus 2000 has earned a reputation as a reliable and
                    time-tested broom that has served many generations of wizards.</p>
